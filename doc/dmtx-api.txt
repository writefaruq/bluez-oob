Device hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Dmtx
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		object CreateOOBDevice(string address)

			Creates a new object path for a out of band (OOB) remote device from bdaddr
                        without actually retrieving any SDP record from it.
			This returns the specified device object.

			If the object for the remote device already exists
			this method will fail.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

            object RemoveOOBDevice(string bdaddr)

			This removes the OOB remote device object at the given
			path if the device is not connected yet.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

            void ConnectOOBDevice(unit32 connection_handle)

			Connect to the remote device with specified handle. If remote device is not paried yet, this
			will also initiate pairing in OOB way. This will require the caller to play the role of a
			proxy OBB device, if the remote device has no OOB support. Particularly for exchanges
			I/O capabilities and performing authentication either in read/write or read-only passive mode.


			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.AlreadyConnected
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed

            void DisconnectOOBDevice()

			Disconnect from the remote device and remove it  from the
			list of OOB devices.

			To abort a connection attempt in case of errors or
			timeouts in the client it is fine to call this method.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed

		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the interface. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments



Signals	    PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.


Properties boolean Connected [readonly]

			Indicates if the remote device is currently connected.
			From this point, the device should be treated as "real" rather
			than just a symbolic one.
			A PropertyChanged signal indicate changes to this
			status.
